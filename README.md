# Discord-Bots
Some discord bots I made

## **List of bots**
* TwitchBot.py - This bot sends a message everytime a specified user is live. It also has a function to send messages when a users type a command (in this case !detalle)
* Autobot-spam.py - This bot is for spamming purposes. Two main functions: spamming random characters or spamming quotes from a given file. Autobots are not allowed anymore but it can be adapted for regular bots.
* Copypaste.py - This bot reads every message from a channel, selects a random one and send it as a message.
